    <h2 class="text-center">How it Started</h2>
    <p class="text-center">
        Created in August 2018, this web application is the result of our collaboration on a final Capstone project for the technical BootCamp,
        Tech Elevator, located in Cincinnati, OH. Tech Elevator is a 14 week program where we learned to develope in the .NET Framework. We
        created whipFLASH to demonstrate and solidify our new technical skills while providing a fun and interactive study tool with a simple user
        interface and intuitive functionality. We hope to continue developing and improving this program with many more features and a solid design.
